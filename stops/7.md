Generated Description

> The map you are observing is a monumental 18th-century work, officially titled the **Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas.** Created under the direction of Spanish Jesuit Father Pedro Murillo Velarde, with drafting by Filipino artist Francisco Suárez, this document represents the first truly comprehensive and scientifically based map of the Philippine archipelago. The vast central space is dedicated to the precise geographical detail of the islands, meticulously delineating coastlines, major ports, and the maritime routes crucial to the trans-Pacific galleon trade.


### Cultural and Geopolitical Significance

The map transcends mere geography, serving as a rich cultural and political record. Flanking the geographical depiction are two vertical columns containing twelve detailed ethnographic vignettes. These panels are critically important, as they depict the multi-ethnic society of the Philippines in the 1730s, featuring various groups like the Chinese Filipinos (Sangleyes), mestizos, and Mardicas, alongside scenes of everyday life, such as farming and cockfighting. The map's upper margin is dominated by a grand cartouche featuring the Spanish royal coat of arms, symbolically affirming imperial authority. Finally, the map holds immense modern significance, as it includes features like Scarborough Shoal (labeled Panacot) and the Spratly Islands (Los Bajos de Paragua), lending it powerful weight in contemporary geopolitical and legal discussions regarding maritime territories.
